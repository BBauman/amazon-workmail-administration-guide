# Step 2: Migrate to Amazon WorkMail<a name="prepare_mail_server"></a>

You can work with any of our migration partners to migrate to Amazon WorkMail\. For information about about these providers, see [Amazon WorkMail](https://aws.amazon.com/workmail/details/)\.

In order to migrate your mailboxes, you can assign an Amazon WorkMail user as the migration administrator\. You can specify the migration administrator in the following ways: 
+ Add the new user **migration\_admin** in the Amazon WorkMail console or create the user **migration\_admin** in your Active Directory and enable this user for Amazon WorkMail\.
+ In the Amazon WorkMail console, on the **Organizations settings** screen, under **Migration settings**, choose **Edit**, and then specify a user that you've designated as the migration administrator for the **migration\_admin** field\.
