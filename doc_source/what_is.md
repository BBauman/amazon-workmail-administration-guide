## Amazon WorkMail Limits<a name="workmail_limits"></a>

Amazon WorkMail can be used by enterprise customers as well as small business owners\. Although we support most use cases without the need to configure any changes in limits, we also protect our users and the internet against abuse of the product\. Therefore, some customers may run into limits that we have set\. This section describes these limits and how to change them\.

Some limit values can be changed, and some are hard limits that cannot be changed\. If you want to change a limit value for Amazon WorkMail, follow these steps to submit a limit increase request:

1. Go to the AWS Support Center, sign in if prompted, and then choose **Create Case**\.

1. Under **Regarding**, choose **Service Limit Increase**\.

1. Under **Limit Type**, choose the type of limit to increase, fill in the necessary form fields, and then choose your preferred method of contact\.

1. If you are requesting a limit increase for a specific organization, enter the **Organization Alias**\.

1. Wait up to five working days for increases to become effective\.

**Note**  
It is possible to request a limit increase regardless of the age of the account\. When you create a new AWS account, the values you are subjected to are usually lower than those for veteran accounts\. On this page, only the default limit values for veteran accounts are listed\.

## Related AWS Services<a name="related_services"></a>

The following services are used along with Amazon WorkMail:

+ **AWS Directory Service**â€”You can integrate Amazon WorkMail with an existing AWS Simple AD, AWS Managed AD, or AD Connector\. Create a directory in the AWS Directory Service and then enable Amazon WorkMail for this directory\. After you've configured this integration, you can choose which users you would like to enable for Amazon WorkMail from a list of users in your existing directory, and users can log in using their existing Active Directory credentials\. For more information, see [AWS Directory Service Administration Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/)\.

+ **Amazon Simple Email Service**â€”Amazon WorkMail uses Amazon SES to send all outgoing email\. The test mail domain and your domains are available for management in the Amazon SES console\. There is no cost for outgoing email sent from Amazon WorkMail\. For more information, see [Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/)\.

+ **AWS Identity and Access Management**â€”The AWS Management Console requires your user name and password so that any service you use can determine whether you have permission to access its resources\. We recommend that you avoid using AWS account credentials to access AWS because AWS account credentials cannot be revoked or limited in any way\. Instead, we recommend that you create an IAM user and add the user to an IAM group with administrative permissions\. You can then access the console using the IAM user credentials\.

  If you signed up for AWS but have not created an IAM user for yourself, you can create one using the IAM console\. For more information, see [Create Individual IAM Users](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAMBestPractices.html#create-iam-users) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

+ **AWS Key Management Service**â€”Amazon WorkMail is integrated with AWS KMS for encryption of customer data\. Key management can be performed from the AWS KMS console\. For more information, see [What is the AWS Key Management Service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*\.
