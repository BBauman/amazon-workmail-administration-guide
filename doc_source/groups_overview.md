# Working with Groups<a name="groups_overview"></a>

Groups can be used as distribution lists in Amazon WorkMail for receiving emails for generic email addresses like sales@example\.com or support@example\.com\. You can also use them as security groups to share a mailbox or calendar with a certain team\. It can take up to 2 hours before newly added groups appear in your Microsoft Outlook offline address book\.
